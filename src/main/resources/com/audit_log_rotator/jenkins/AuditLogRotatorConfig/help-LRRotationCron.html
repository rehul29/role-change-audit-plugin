<div>
    This field follows the syntax of cron. Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace:
<pre>MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW </pre>
<table><tbody><tr><td>MINUTE</td><td>Minutes within the hour (0–59)</td></tr><tr><td>HOUR</td><td>The hour of the day (0–23)</td></tr><tr><td>DOM</td><td>The day of the month (1–31)</td></tr><tr><td>MONTH</td><td>The month (1–12)</td></tr><tr><td>DOW</td><td>The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are available. In the order of precedence,</p>
* specifies all valid values
M-N specifies a range of values
M-N/X or */X steps by intervals of X through the specified range or whole valid range
A,B,...,Z enumerates multiple values
To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system, the symbol H (for “hash”) should be used wherever possible. For example, using 0 0 * * * for a dozen daily jobs will cause a large spike at midnight. In contrast, using H H * * * would still execute each job once a day, but not all at the same time, better using limited resources.
<br/>
The H symbol can be used with a range. For example, H H(0-7) * * * means some time between 12:00 AM (midnight) to 7:59 AM. You can also use step intervals with H, with or without ranges.
<br/>
The H symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range, but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that the value remains stable for any given project.

<ul><li><code>*</code> specifies all valid values</li><li><code>M-N</code> specifies a range of values</li><li><code>M-N/X</code> or <code>*/X</code> steps by intervals of X through the specified range or whole valid range</li><li><code>A,B,...,Z</code> enumerates multiple values</li></ul><p>
    To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system,
    the symbol <code>H</code> (for “hash”) should be used wherever possible.
    For example, using <code>0 0 * * *</code> for a dozen daily jobs
    will cause a large spike at midnight.
    In contrast, using <code>H H * * *</code> would still execute each job once a day,
    but not all at the same time, better using limited resources.
  </p><p>
    The <code>H</code> symbol can be used with a range. For example, <code>H H(0-7) * * *</code>
    means some time between 12:00 AM (midnight) to 7:59 AM.
    You can also use step intervals with <code>H</code>, with or without ranges.
  </p><p>
    The <code>H</code> symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range,
    but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that
    the value remains stable for any given project.
  </p><p>
      Beware that for the day of month field, short cycles such as <code>*/3</code> or <code>H/3</code> will not work consistently near the end of most months, due to variable month lengths.
      For example, <code>*/3</code> will run on the 1st, 4th, …31st days of a long month, then again the next day of the next month.
      Hashes are always chosen in the 1-28 range, so <code>H/3</code> will produce a gap between runs of between 3 and 6 days at the end of a month.
      (Longer cycles will also have inconsistent lengths but the effect may be relatively less noticeable.)

Examples:
</p>
<pre>
# Every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52):
H/15 * * * *
# Every ten minutes in the first half of every hour (three times, perhaps at :04, :14, :24):
H(0-29)/10 * * * *
# Once every two hours at 45 minutes past the hour starting at 9:45 AM and finishing at 3:45 PM every weekday:
45 9-16/2 * * 1-5
# Once in every two hour slot between 8 AM and 4 PM every weekday (perhaps at 9:38 AM, 11:38 AM, 1:38 PM, 3:38 PM):
H H(8-15)/2 * * 1-5
# Once a day on the 1st and 15th of every month except December:
H H 1,15 1-11 *
</pre>
<h3> Current Time Zone is shown in description, make sure to adjust cron as per current timezone.</h3>
Example:
<pre>
# If the current time zone is UTC, and you want to schedule cron for Indian Standard Time 16:48 then use the following expression (adjusting 5 hours and 30 minutes):
18 11 * * *
</pre>
